title: Bossing the Gig Economy - Statement of Work
---

The “Gig Economy” is the system where individuals/organizations contract short-term onsite or remote workers to perform specific jobs. The gig economy is worth 300 billion dollars and will hit a trillion dollars in the next decade or so.  

Remote working and freelancing, especially in the technological arena, is quickly becoming the best choice for skilled workers who are not keen to tie themselves down to specific organizations but would instead choose to work project to project.  

One of the biggest problem facing freelancers trying to get into the “Gig Economy” is finding the right formula to charge their clients for their services. Understanding the value of your skill is vital. Freelancers work on a profit-loss model, your input in time, cost, and knowledge must not be more than the payment you receive at the end of the project. Keeping records of the time you spend on a project per day, any cost you accrue travelling, researching, internet charges, among others, is key to justifying your wage demands.  

Many freelancers do not take contracting seriously. A project contract must have targets, milestones, deliverables, a budget, well-defined limitations, and the mode of payment. A client cannot change goals midway without the freelancer varying their terms to cost for the change.  

A Statement of Work is a binding document that regulates all the above requirement. A well-defined Statement of Work ensures that both the client and the freelancer have a proper way of measuring each other’s responsibilities towards the project. The document acts as the marking sheet for work delivered, its quality and cost, and most importantly, as evidence in case there are legal issues to be sorted. A Statement of Work indemnifies the freelancer from rogue clientele.  

The geek economy provides excellent opportunities to all of us, from techies to content producers, online teachers to writers and other digital operations. Freelancers can exploit it successfully by arming ourselves with the knowledge to negotiate the best contracts of themselves.
