My name is Brian Koech, I am originally from Kenya, East Africa but I now live, study and work in Western Australia.  

G'day, mate!

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Technology, and Master of a Science in Information Technology (Internetworking and Security).  

My academic and professional interest is primarily in Networking and Security, although my love for coding has allowed me to continue developing various systems for gig clients. I love Python: I am enjoying learning to craft great applications using Python Flask, and intergrating Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence into them.
