I am Network Engineer with just over six years in the industry. My current role involves working with small and medium-sized companies who seek to expand their footprint hence require to upgrade their networks to be productive while keeping the cost of investment as low as possible.  
 I am currently focusing on Network Automation, Cloud Computing and NetDevOps as a means of achieving the results mentioned above.  
 Privately, I build web and other microservices applications to assist gig clients to achieve simple tasks like registering new clients, time logging employee hours, and receiving online payments. I primarily use Python and Flask to accomplish this.  
 I am currently enhancing my knowledge in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Language, as I have seen a lot of potential areas of exploitation both in the Networking and Core IT world.  
 Feel free to contact me for collaboration, or to talk about tech.
