I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Technology, and Master of a Science in Information Technology (Internetworking and Security).  

I am currently undertaking research for my doctoral thesis, as a part-time student.  

My academic and professional interest is primarily in Networking and Security, although my love for coding has allowed me to continue developing various systems for gig clients. I love Python: I am enjoying learning to craft useful applications using Python Flask and integrating Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence into them.  

My current role involves working with small and medium-sized companies who seek to expand their footprint hence require to upgrade their networks and Core IT systems in order to be productive while keeping the cost of investment as low as possible.  

I am currently focusing on Network Automation, Cloud Computing and NetDevOps as a means of achieving the results mentioned above.  

Privately, I build web-based microservices applications to assist gig clients achieve simple tasks like registering new clients, time logging employee hours, and receiving online payments. I primarily use Python and Flask to accomplish this.  

I am currently enhancing my knowledge in Artificial Intelligence and Machine Language, as I have seen a lot of potential areas of exploitation both in the Networking and Core IT world.  

Feel free to contact me for collaboration, or to talk about tech.
